## Notes
Given the data provided I just took the average for the day and then plotted. It seems like a pretty straitforward task and you can work on the plotting for months and years. If you provide me the years worth of data I can do it for you. But you can just create a plotting function and stick it into a loop to generate the plots you want for months and years.

Hopefully this is what you want ..but there is a possibility that I did not understand the complexity of the task and just took the easy out approach. :)
